  Read, edit, and reason about Task Tree boards — nested Markdown checklists in an Obsidian vault
  with roll-up progress, block ids, and dependencies. Use when the user mentions a Task Tree board,
  an Obsidian task list or Kanban in Markdown, nested checklist tasks, roll-up progress, blocked
  tasks or dependencies between tasks, breaking a project or goal into subtasks, task-notes, or
  managing project documentation as Markdown checklists (`type: task-tree` files).

# Task Tree — operating an agent-ready Markdown task board

A Task Tree board is a plain Markdown note: frontmatter `type: task-tree`, then one nested
checklist. Parents derive their state from children (roll-up); every task can carry a stable `^id`,
a manual `[tt-override:: role]`, dependencies `[tt-blocked-by:: id, id]`, and its own linked note.
The full rules are in [reference/contract.md](reference/contract.md) — **read it before writing to
a board.** The three iron rules:

1. Only touch files whose frontmatter says `type: task-tree` (boards) — task-note frontmatter is
   plugin-managed.
2. Preserve every `tt-` field and `^id` when rewriting a line; never invent or reuse ids.
3. Change state on **leaves**; parents follow by roll-up. One structural edit per write.

## Recipes

### Survey a vault
Find every board: grep for `type: task-tree` in frontmatter across `*.md`. For each, compute
roll-up (post-order; rules in the reference) and report: total tasks, done, doing, blocked, and the
top-level milestones with their derived states. Never store computed progress in the files.

### Report status of one board
Parse the checklist into a tree by indentation. Compute each parent's role bottom-up. Summarize as
the human thinks: milestones with `K/D` progress, what's in flight, what's blocked and *why*
(the blocked leaf + its ancestor path).

### "What's blocked, and why?"
Two sources, report both:
- **Status blockers**: leaves whose char maps to `blocked` (`!` by default) — name the leaf and its path.
- **Dependency holds**: tasks with `[tt-blocked-by:: …]` whose targets aren't `done`/`cancelled`
  — name what they wait on. Flag unknown ids and cycles; never silently drop them.

### Break a goal into subtasks
Add nested `- [ ]` lines under the parent, one indent unit deeper (match the file's unit — tab by
default). Propose the decomposition first if the user hasn't specified it; structure is the
human's call. Don't add ids by hand — the plugin auto-assigns them (or run its "Assign block IDs"
command).

### Mark work done — and explain what rolled up
Flip the leaf's char to `x` (Operation B: exactly that character, nothing else on the line).
Then recompute the ancestors and tell the user what changed: "*Staging box* done → *Infrastructure*
2/2 → its override is now redundant" or "*QA pass* released *Announcement post*'s dependency."

### Wire a dependency
Append `[tt-blocked-by:: <target-id>]` before the task's trailing `^id` (comma-separate multiple
ids). Targets are bare block ids on the same board. Check you're not creating a cycle.

### Build a board from existing docs
From a project's Markdown docs, draft a board: `---\ntype: task-tree\ntitle: "<name>"\n---`, then
the checklist — milestones as top-level tasks, concrete actions as leaves. Statuses only where the
docs are explicit; everything else `[ ]`. Show the draft before writing the file, and let the
plugin assign ids afterward.

### Keep board and reality in sync
On request, diff what the docs/conversation say happened against the board: leaves to flip, new
tasks to add, tasks that look cancelled. Apply leaf flips freely; propose structural changes and
cancellations — those are the human's.
